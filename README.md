# DatasOnTelecom

This repository include some internal documents which came from Telecom. 

The size of this repository about 3.5 gigabytes.  

If you like that can feel free to clone it to your local. 

But I will pick some significant files then upload to other net disks platform.

It is also welcome that Unicom and Mobile enterprise employees to pick files for your necessary here ,thanks!

The ability of my English is better than anyone on Telecom!

The leaders of telecom just like silly,stupid,foolish idiots. They don't know any advanced IT techs such as Git,Python,Selenium,Jira or automation,API,performance test. 

Almost all of systems on telecom were developed by outdated techs and even part of them were developed by java development toolkit version 6. Are you kidding me?

The telecom also recruit the college graduated student. But he look likes a silly idot who was complained by other employees and know nothing.

Do less job but get similar salary and get off work on time. Don't worry about who would do such work. 

The lunkhead will do it ASAP. If he had no time, he also would write some documents then tell you how to do it. That's so easy and convenient! 

I'm used to such work status starts from the first day to here. What a joke is that just risen by one thousand for salary in three years!

The role of signed company is only to give me salary and pay taxes with no other effect!

The level of salary on signed company is lower than average and no more chance to raise salary. It's necessary to find a better job to realize job hopping.

I won't tell anyone on Telecom (Include the idiot leader and lunkhead) that I will go to interview on other company. 

One day I would left the Telecom that I also won't tell them and only say it to HR of the signed company.
